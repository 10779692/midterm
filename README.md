I am building an employee database. As of right now, this entire platform is built using .php and MySQL. Everything is pulling from a table named "directory". You can find the column names within the code. I am attempting to have the ability for a user to add a photo to an employee, or add a photo from editing an already existing employee. This photo will be stored in the MySQL database and then shown on top of the name of the employee. 

My two main problems: 

1.) I cannot seem to figure out how to make that happen. Already in MySQL, I have the "photo" column set as "longblob" so I believe I have set that part up right. 

2.) At the moment, the editemployee.php file is set to manually edit the employee with the column id #2. That currently is Alexander Hamiliton. Ideally, I would like to enter a name in the form and edit their contents from there.
